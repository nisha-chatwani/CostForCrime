        <td class= "row"><p>It is legal if the person is following “the instructions of his or her parent, legal guardian, responsible adult relative, or adult designee relating to disposition of the alcoholic beverage.” This can be either in delivering the beverage (such as carrying it from the car parked on the street to the house), or throwing it in the trash can that is set out on the curb. It also includes handling the beverage as part of the defendant’s occupation, such as serving alcohol as a waiter or waitress.
Possession
Possession does not simply mean that the defendant had the drink in his or her hand. It can also be applied “constructively,” which means that the defendant had or shared control with another over the beverage. For example, if you went to the beach, and were drinking from a beer bottle that you then put down on a towel nearby, you are still considered to be in possession of the bottle.
